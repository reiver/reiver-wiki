§ Wiki

by ((Charles Iliya Krempeaux))

A **wiki** is a type of **digital writing** that makes it **quick and easy** for people to create //formatted// **hyper‐text** — i.e., text that is both **formatted‐text** and **hyper‐text**.

So there are 3 main properties of a **wiki**:

• it is **formatted‐text**,
• it is **hyper‐text**, and
• it is **quick and easy** for people to create.

(And note that, what we mean by “//people//” is left ambiguous in this description.
Which means that, what is considered //quick and easy// will depend on who the //people// are.
For example, what is in general considered //quick and easy// to most random regular //people// could be different than is considered //quick and easy// if the //people// were just software engineers.)

Earlier on (when the word **wiki** was first being used) a 4th property was also considered a requirement:

• the writing and editing experience can be **collaborative** with people (in a //turn-based// manner).

But, over time this property seems to have been dropped as a requirement, as there are things that aren't //collaborative// in this way that are still called **wikis**.

But once can also talk about a **personal-wiki** versus a **collaborative-wiki**.

§§ Formatted‐Text

**Formatted‐Text** is writing that supports:

• //bolding// text,
• //italicizing// text,
• //coloring// text,
• //under‐lining// text,
• //over‐lining// text,
• creating //sub‐scripts//,
• creating //super‐scripts//,
• //sizing// text (i.e,. making the font‐size larger or smaller),
• using different //fonts// with text (include //monospaced fonts// and //proportional fonts//),
• creating //horizontal rules//,
• creating //paragraphs//,
• creating //lists// (including nested //lists//),
• creating //block quotations//,
• etc.

§§ Hyper‐Text

**Hyper‐Text** is writing that supports //hyper‐links//.

§§ Data‐Format versus Software‐Platform

There are 2 main ways of thinking about //what is a wiki// —

• a **wiki** is a type of **data-format**, and
• a **wiki** is a type of **software-platform**.

To make it so the word **wiki** isn't ambiguous, we can instead talk about:

• a **wiki-format**, and
• a **wiki-platform**.

§§ Wiki-Format

There are a number of different **wiki** formats:

• [[c2wiki-format]] (which is the original wiki-format!),
• [[cvwiki-format]],
• [[confluence-format]],
• [[dokuwiki-format]],
• [[mediawiki-format]],
• [[phpwiki-format]],
• [[wiki/1]],
• etc.

§§ Wiki Etymology

The (English) word **wiki** is a shortening of the phrase **wiki wiki web** (which is sometimes written as **WikiWikiWeb**).
The phrase **wiki wiki web** is derived from the **Hawaiian** word “//wikiwiki//” — which means //fast//, //speedy//, and //quick//.

As the story goes —
**Howard G. Cunningham** (who usually goes by “Ward”) was at the //Honolulu International Airport// in **Hawaii**.
At one point while Ward Cunningham was there, an employee at the //Honolulu International Airport// told Ward Cunningham to take the **wiki wiki shuttle** — which is the name of a free //shuttle bus// available at the //Honolulu International Airport// in **Hawaii**.
Later when Ward Cunningham was trying to think up a name for software he was creating.
He first thought about naming the software //quick web//, but later decided to call it //wiki wiki web// — effectively naming it after the //wiki wiki shuttle//.

(Ward Cunningham created what is considered the first **wiki** — which he (eventually) called **wiki wiki web** (or **WikiWikiWeb**) and was hosted on the Internet‐domain ``wiki.c2.com``.
Ward Cunningham is also usually (mainly) credited for the word **wiki** (also) becoming an English word meaning — a form of //quick and easy// digital writing that supports //formatted‐text// and //hyper‐text// — rather than just meaning //quick//, //fast//, //switft//.)

Interestingly, the **Hawaiian** word “//wikiwiki//” is //reduplication// of the **Hawaiian** word “//wiki//” — which means //to hurry//, //to hasten//, //quick//, //fast//, //swift//.

Thus, the English word “//wiki//” is derived from the Hawaiian word “//wikiwiki//” which itself is derived from the Hawaiian word “//wiki//”.
So, //we have come full circle// 🙂

The **Hawaiian** //reduplication// “//wikiwiki//” is similar to the English //reduplications// “//go go//”, “//hurry hurry//” and “//quickly quickly//”.

The English //reduplications// “//quickly quickly//” can be see in (some of) the lyrics to the song (meant for babies and very young children) called //slowly, slowly creeps the garden snail//:

― Quickly, quickly, very quickly runs the little mouse. ― Quickly, quickly, very quickly round about the house.

For completeness, one should also note another **Hawaiian** word: “//alawiki//” — which means //hurry//, //quick//, //fast//.
